**Proposal for Replacing HTTP Client in Spring-based Project**

**1. Executive Summary**

This document presents an evaluation of available HTTP client libraries and frameworks to replace the existing client in our Spring MVC/Boot application (Spring 5.x). It outlines the business and technical drivers, examines candidate solutions, compares their strengths and weaknesses, and concludes with a recommended approach and high-level migration plan.

---

**2. Context & Introduction**

* **Background**: Our application, currently running on Spring Framework 5.x, uses the legacy `RestTemplate` for synchronous HTTP calls. Going forward, the Spring community has deprecated `RestTemplate` in favor of modern, non-blocking alternatives.
* **Business Drivers**:

  * Improve performance and scalability under high concurrency.
  * Simplify reactive data flows and back-pressure handling for downstream APIs.
  * Leverage newer Spring features and maintain long-term support compatibility.
* **Technical Requirements**:

  1. Support for both synchronous and asynchronous/non-blocking calls.
  2. Seamless integration with existing Spring configuration and security setup.
  3. Ease of testing (mocking, stubbing HTTP interactions).
  4. Mature ecosystem and community support.
  5. Clear migration path from current `RestTemplate` usage.

**6. Recommendation**

Based on our evaluation, **Spring WebClient** emerges as the optimal choice for the following reasons:

1. **Future-Proof & Spring-Aligned**: WebClient is the official Spring project recommendation for HTTP clients in Spring 5 and beyond.
2. **Reactive & Scalable**: Enables non-blocking calls, improving throughput under load and reducing thread exhaustion.
3. **Feature-Rich**: Native support for reactive operators, pluggable filters, and seamless integration with Spring Security and Cloud features.

**Trade-offs & Mitigations**:

* **Learning Curve**: Plan training sessions and pair programming to get the team up to speed on Reactor concepts.
* **Migration Effort**: Adopt a phased approach—start with low-risk services, use `.block()` in transitional code, then gradually refactor to full reactive streams.

---

**7. Migration Plan**

1. **Pilot Phase**:

   * Select a small, non-critical service for WebClient proof-of-concept.
   * Implement one or two HTTP interactions using WebClient, measure performance and identify gaps.
2. **Training & Knowledge Transfer**:

   * Host workshops on Reactor core (Mono/Flux) and WebClient best practices.
   * Share documentation and code samples.
3. **Incremental Migration**:

   * Migrate existing `RestTemplate` beans to expose `WebClient` beans via Spring JavaConfig.
   * For each service, create feature branch: convert one endpoint at a time, with fallback tests.
4. **Performance & Resilience Testing**:

   * Execute load tests to validate non-blocking behavior.
   * Integrate Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker for resilience.
5. **Rollout & Monitoring**:

   * Deploy gradually, monitor key metrics (latency, error rates, thread usage).
   * Roll back in case of regressions.
6. **Full Decommissioning**:

   * Remove all `RestTemplate` code once migration completes.
   * Clean up unused dependencies and configuration.

**8. Conclusion**

Adopting **Spring WebClient** aligns with our strategic goals of performance, scalability, and maintainability. A structured migration plan with a pilot phase, training, and incremental roll-out will ensure minimal disruption. This investment will future-proof our application and provide the flexibility to embrace reactive paradigms as business demands grow.
