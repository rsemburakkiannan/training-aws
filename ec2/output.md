Duplicate Event Handling: S3 event notifications may deliver duplicate events - ensure downstream systems implement idempotency using unique identifiers or checksums
Missing Events: In rare scenarios, S3 may not generate an event notification - implement periodic reconciliation jobs to detect missing events
Event Ordering: Events are not guaranteed to arrive in chronological order - use object version IDs or timestamps for proper sequencing
Cross-Region Replication: Events from cross-region replication may arrive with delays - consider this for time-sensitive financial data processing
Prefix Filtering: Use specific prefix/suffix filters to avoid unnecessary event generation and reduce costs
Event Types: Choose appropriate event types (ObjectCreated, ObjectRemoved) to minimize noise and processing overhead
Dead Letter Queue: Configure DLQ for event notification targets to handle processing failures
Encryption: Ensure events contain metadata about encryption status for compliance tracking
Access Logging: Enable CloudTrail for S3 API calls to audit event notification configurations
Rate Limiting: Be aware that high-frequency object operations may throttle event delivery
